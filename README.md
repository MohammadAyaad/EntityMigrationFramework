**A type-safe data migration framework for .NET applications**  
*Early-stage solution for model versioning and evolution with compile-time validated transformations*

---

## üöß Project Status: Early Alpha üöß

This project is currently in **active early development** and should be considered experimental. Key notes:

üî• **Not production-ready**  
üî® **API surface will change**  
üìñ **Documentation is incomplete**  
‚ö° **Performance not optimized**

**Proceed with caution** - ideal for experimentation and feedback, not production systems.

## üìö Documentation

Explore our growing documentation at:  
[https://mohammadayaad.github.io/EntityMigrationFramework](https://mohammadayaad.github.io/EntityMigrationFramework)

Current documentation covers:
- Basic concepts
- Core API reference
- Example application walkthrough

---

## ‚ú® Features

\```csharp
// Type-safe migration implementation
public class UserMigration : IMigration<UserV1, UserV2> 
{
    public UserV2 Migrate(UserV1 src) => new() 
    {
        // Compile-time validated transformation
        FullName = $"{src.FirstName} {src.LastName}"
    };
}
\```

- Automatic migration path resolution
- Strong type validation
- Customizable registry system
- Version chain validation

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Add the core package:
\```bash
dotnet add package EntityMigrationFramework
\```

2. Create your first migration:
\```csharp
public class SampleMigration : IMigration<OldModel, NewModel> 
{
    public NewModel Migrate(OldModel src) => new() 
    {
        // Transformation logic
    };
}
\```

3. Configure the manager:
\```csharp
var manager = new MigrationBuilder<BaseModel>()
    .AddMigration<SampleMigration, OldModel, NewModel>()
    .Prepare()
    .UseDefaultRegistry()
    .Build();
\```

## üîç Example Application

Explore the reference implementation in:  
`/src/EntityMigrationExampleApp`

Demonstrates:
- Multi-step model evolution
- Direct and indirect migrations
- JSON serialization integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

**This project urgently needs:**
- API surface refinement
- Documentation improvements
- Test coverage
- Performance optimizations

While formal guidelines are being developed, please:
1. Open an issue to discuss changes
2. Keep PRs focused and well-documented
3. Follow existing code patterns
